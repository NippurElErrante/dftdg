**Danger From The Deep** is a community-driven effort to revive and modernize the classic WWII German submarine simulator.

This project aims to migrate the original game's code and logic to the **Godot Engine**, enabling better cross-platform compatibility, improved performance, and easier addition of new features.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1.  **Migration to Godot Engine:** Fully port the codebase and assets from "Danger from the Deep" into a functional Godot Engine project.
2.  **Preservation:** Maintain the gameplay and atmosphere of the original simulator.
3.  **Improvements and Expansion:** Implement:
    *   Graphical enhancements (lighting, shaders, higher-quality models).
    *   Performance optimizations and gameplay refinements.
    *   Fixes for historical bugs present in the original game.
    *   New missions, ships, or gameplay mechanics.
4.  **Open Source:** Keep the project 100% free and accessible to the community.
